## How to Play. 
- The ball bounces off the bat randomly in normal mode.
- If boost is active, the ball bounces off according to where it collides with the bat.
- Balancing the ball on bat and destroying the diamonds using the boosted ball gives points.
- Get the highscore.
---------
- I left the debug imgui in the game where you can modify the volumes etc. Press `TAB` to access.
